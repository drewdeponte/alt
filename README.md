# Alt

`alt` is a command line utility that attempts to find the "alternate path" for
the provided path. This is primarily intended for developers. It is written in
Rust. Hence, it is compiled and distributed as a binary.

It was originally written to alternate files in vim, but has no dependency on
vim at all and can be used in many other scenarios as it is just a command line
utility.

Its interface is as simple as they come.

* Pass it a path as the first argument
* It will print the alternate path to standard out

For example:

```text
$ alt spec/app/queues/fee/user_fee_submission_spec.rb
app/queues/fee/user_fee_submission.rb
```

asked questions please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/uptech/alt/wiki).

## Installation

If you are on a platform other than Mac OS X (macOS) or Arch Linux you will have
to build your own version from source.

### macOS

To install on Mac OS X or (MacOS) we provide a [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) tap
which provides the `alt` formula. You can use it by doing the following:

#### Add the Tap

```
brew tap "uptech/homebrew-oss"
```

#### brew install

```
brew install uptech/oss/alt
```

### Arch Linux

Install from the AUR:

```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/alt-git.git
cd alt-git
makepkg -si
```

### Build from Source

If you are on another platform you will have to build from source. Given
that `alt` is managed via Rust's Cargo. It can build as follows:

```
$ cargo build --release
```

Once you have built it successfully you should relocate the
`target/release/alt` binary to a location that exists in your `PATH` so
that you can easily use it.

*Note:* The above requires of course that you have [rust](http://rust-lang.org)
and Cargo.

## Use with Vim

There's no vim plugin. It may not end up needing one; we'll see. For now, you
can just stick the code below in your `.vimrc` to invoke `alt` with `<leader>.`.
**Note** that `alt` and the Vim Script example below **work** in both the
terminal based Vim and GUI based Vim like MacVim.

```vimscript
" Run a given vim command on the results of alt from a given path.
" See usage below.
function! AltCommand(path, vim_command)
  let l:alternate = system("alt " . a:path)
  if empty(l:alternate)
    echo "No alternate file for " . a:path . " exists!"
  else
    exec a:vim_command . " " . l:alternate
  endif
endfunction

" Find the alternate file for the current path and open it
nnoremap <leader>. :w<cr>:call AltCommand(expand('%'), ':e')<cr>
```

### Faster with Less Noise

So, `alt` supports passing the set of possible alternate paths in via STDIN
rather than using the built-in glob mechanism it provides by default. This is an
extremely powerful feature as it allows you to use an external tool, like
`find`, to produce a filtered list of possible alternate paths. Filtering in
this manner benefits you in two ways. First it eliminates noise you don't care
about from the possible paths. Second, it reduces the set of possible paths
`alt` has to process, in turn making `alt` faster.

The following is how I have `alt` setup in my `vimrc` using `find` to produce
the set of alternate paths.

```vimscript
" Run a given vim command on the results of alt from a given path.
" See usage below.
function! AltCommand(path, vim_command)
	let l:alternate = system("find . -path ./_site -prune -or -path ./target -prune -or -path ./.DS_Store -prune -or -path ./build -prune -or -path ./Carthage -prune -or -path tags -prune -or -path ./tmp -prune -or -path ./log -prune -or -path ./.git -prune -or -type f -print | alt -f - " . a:path)
	if empty(l:alternate)
		echo "No alternate file for " . a:path . " exists!"
	else
		exec a:vim_command . " " . l:alternate
	endif
endfunction

" Find the alternate file for the current path and open it
nnoremap <leader>. :w<cr>:call AltCommand(expand('%'), ':e')<cr>
```

Details on passing the potential alternate paths in via STDIN can be found in
